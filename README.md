# First GAN - MNIST Digit Generation

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through building and training your first Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The goal is to create a GAN that can generate handwritten images of digits (0-9) based on the MNIST dataset. This project is built using PyTorch.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this notebook, you will learn to:
1.  Build the generator and discriminator components of a GAN from scratch.
2.  Create generator and discriminator loss functions.
3.  Train your GAN and visualize the generated images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

### Installation

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib tqdm
